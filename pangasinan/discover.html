                <h1>The Economy of Pangasinan</h1>
                <p>The economies of Pangasinan are based on the agro-industrial and service sectors, with agriculture playing a key role in the northern part of the territory. The production of milkfish (bangus), rearing livestock, making a fish paste (bagoong), and other agro-industrial activities are the main drivers of the Pangasinan economy. However, there is no denying the value of trade, financial services, and educational services to the economy. Growing rice, tobacco, corn, sugarcane, and fruits, and raising pigs, chickens, goats, and carabaos are the main sources of income in the northern Ilocos provinces (water buffalos). Pangasinan has export earnings of around $5.5 million.</p><br>
                <p>The national government's collection of tax income can be used to determine the distribution of economic activity in the area. The majority of the receipts—61% of the total—come from Pangasinan. The region's land transportation companies, such as Farinas Transit Company and Partas, as well as regional airlines, fuel the tourism economy, which concentrates on eco-tourism and coastal beaches. There are also plenty of opportunities to participate in other water sports and activities. Ecotourism makes use of the sea and forest resources in the area and showcases Region 1's natural beauty.</p>
