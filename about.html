            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Crescent-shaped and located along the coast, Pangasinan is a home to at least 3 million Pangasinenses. It is comprised of 44 municipalities and 4 cities. Strategically located in the north of the Philippines, Pangasinan is arguably a hidden paradise. The province’s capital – Lingayen – is historically known as the site where General Douglas MacArthur set foot in World War II after sailing through Lingayen Gulf in pursuit of the hostile Japanese army. Others know Pangasinan as the birthplace of the country’s national anthem, Lupang Hinirang which originated from a poem written by Jose Palma when he stayed in Bautista, Pangasinan in 1899. During the Philippine-American War from 1899 to 1913, it is known that the Pangasinan town of Bayambang became the seat of government of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo for a time.</p>

            <h1>About Pangasinan</h1>
            <p>The third biggest province in the whole Philippine Archipelago derived its name from salt or “asin” in the vernacular. Owing to the rich and fine salt beds which were the prime source of livelihood for the province’s coastal towns, PanagASINan or “Pangasinan” which means “where salt is made” came to be its name.</p><br>
            <p>The province is crescent-shaped and occupies 536,818 hectares of land area which constitutes almost one-half (41.8%) of the total land area of Region 1 and 1.8% of the total area of the Philippines. Composed of 4 cities and 44 municipalities, it is bounded on the north by the Lingayen Gulf, La Union, and Benguet, on the north-east by Nueva Vizcaya, on the east by Nueva Ecija, on the south by Tarlac, and on the west by Zambales and the China Sea.</p>

            <h1>Cuisine</h1>
            <p>Pangasinan is known for its beautiful sceneries and nature’s wonders: from cave systems, white sand beaches, islands, falls to its unique and delectable selection of foods. Traditional Pangasinan dishes are noted with its use of bagoong (fish paste) in their veggie dishes and cow or goat innards with their meat soup dishes, while desserts are primarily made of rice made sweet in sugar and coconut concoctions and made with a tempting aroma by cooking it under wood.</p>
